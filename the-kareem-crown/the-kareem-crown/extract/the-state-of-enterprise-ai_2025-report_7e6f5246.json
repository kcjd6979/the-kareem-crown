As firms transition from experimentation to production deployments, APl consumption has rapidly increased. More than 9,oo0 organizations have now processed over 10 billion tokens, and nearly 200 have exceeded 1 trillion tokens.  \n\nAverage reasoning token consumption per organization has increased by approximately $320\\times$ in the past 12 months, suggesting that more intelligent models are being systematically integrated into expanding products and services. Codex, while still early in its enterprise lifecycle, is gaining rapid traction as teams adopt it for end-to-end software tasks: code generation, refactoring, testing, and debugging.  \n\nIn the past six weeks, Codex engagement indicates growing penetration of Al-assisted development inside enterprises.  \n\n2x  \n\n50%  \n\nIncrease in weekly active users  \n\nApproximate increase in weekly messages  \n\nWorkers report measurablevalue from using Al  \n\nIn most settings, Al enables workers to produce higher quality work faster. However, productivity alone does not fully reflect how Al is reshaping work. Survey data from almost 1o0 enterprises highlights key operational gains across functions, and shifts in who performs specialized and technical work.  \n\nEnterprise workers report time saved and improved outcomes across functions  \n\nSeventy-five percent of surveyed workers report that using Al at work has improved either the speed or quality of their output. On average, ChatGPT Enterprise users attribute 40-60 minutes of time saved per active day to their use of Al, with data science, engineering, and communications workers saving more than average (60-80 minutes per day). Time saved per message varies by function: accounting and finance users report the largest benefits followed by analytics, communications, and engineering.  \n\nThese gains translate into broad operational improvements across functions  \n\n$87\\%$ of IT workers report faster IT issue resolution  \n\n$85\\%$ of marketing and product users report faster campaign execution  \n\n$75\\%$ of HR professionals report improved employee engagement  \n\n$73\\%$ of engineers report faster code delivery  \n\nThese results indicate that productivity benefits are already materializing across core enterprise functions, not only in early-adopting technical roles.  \n\nTechnical work expands beyond traditional role boundaries  \n\nAl is not only accelerating existing work; it is also expanding the tasks and skills workers can perform. Several studies find that Al has an equalizing effect, disproportionately aiding lower performing workers.' Consistent with these findings, $75\\%$ of workers report being able to complete tasks they previously could not perform, including programming support and code review, spreadsheet analysis and automation, technical tool development and troubleshooting, and custom GPT or agent design.  \n\nThe broadening of individual capabilities is particularly apparent in technical settings, where non-technical teams are increasingly engaging in coding and data-analysis work that was previously confined to specialized roles. Among ChatGPT Enterprise users, coding-related messages have increased across all functions, and outside of engineering, IT, and research, coding-related messages have grown by an average of $36\\%$ over the past six months.  \n\nWorkers report greater productivity from more intensive Al use  \n\nAt the individual worker level, impact increases as workers deepen their use of Al. Across a large sample of workers, time saved is correlated with the use of more advanced ChatGPT features, including Deep Research, GPT-5 Thinking, and Image Generation. Workers consuming the most intelligence (as measured by credits used?) report higher time savings. Workers who save more than 10 hours per week are not just using more intelligence, they are also using multiple models, engaging with more tools, and using Al across a wider range of tasks.  \n\n75% of users report being able to complete new tasks  \n\n36%  \n\n  \nProductivity gains increase with intensity of Al use  \n\nAverage increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research  \n\nPace of acceleration varies based on industry and geography  \n\nOver the last year we've seen overall rapid adoption as companies move from Al pilots to full deployments, and there are notable differences based on industry and geography.  \n\nGrowth is rapid across most industries  \n\nOpenAl customer growth is broad-based across industries, with the median sector expanding more than 6x year-over-year and even the slowest-growing sector exceeding 2x.  \n\nAl adoption by industry: enterprise scale vs. year-over-year growth  \n\nTechnology, healthcare, and manufacturing show the fastest growth, while finance and professional services operate at the largest scale  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nIn absolute terms, ChatGPT Enterprise customers are most concentrated today in professional services, finance, and technology, sectors that were early adopters and continue to lead in their scale of Al usage. Healthcare and manufacturing started from a much smaller base but are now among the fastest-growing sectors, rapidly closing the gap.  \n\nYear-over-year customer growth  \n\n01. Technology   \n02.

Manufacturing   \n11x   \n8x   \n7x\n\n2025 REP0RT  \n\nThe state of enterprise Al  \n\nAt OpenAl, our mission is to ensure that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity, and helping enterprises solve problems is central to this mission.  \n\nThe majority of economically valuable activity takes place inside organizations, where innovation translates directly into improved outcomes for workers, customers, and other stakeholders. Enterprise problems also present the hardest technical challenges for frontier intelligence, requiring reliability, safety, and security at scale. The revenue generated from solving these problems can help fund broad, free access to powerful Al for hundreds of millions of people worldwide.  \n\nFor much of the past three years, the visible impact of Al has been most apparent among consumers. However, the history of general purpose technologies—from steam engines to semiconductors—shows that significant economic value is created after firms translate underlying capabilities into scaled use cases. Enterprise Al now appears to be entering this phase, as many of the world's largest and most complex organizations are starting to use Al as core infrastructure.  \n\nMore than 1 million business customers now use OpenAl's tools. This report brings together evidence from de-identified and aggregated enterprise usage data and a variety of other sources to provide a grounded view of how Al is being deployed inside organizations today.  \n\nFour key findings stand out  \n\n01 intensity of usage has increased.Enterprise usage is scaling, with deeper workflow integration. ChatGPT message volume grew 8x and APl reasoning token consumption per organization increased 320x year-over-year, demonstrating that more enterprises are using Al and their02Enterprises that leverage Al are experiencing measurable productivity and business impact. technical tasks such as data analysis and coding. Case studies indicate Al is contributing toproduct-development cycles. 03months, international adoption has surged as organizations worldwide deepen their use of Al,04A widening gap is emerging between leaders and laggards. Frontier workers are sending 6x more messages and frontier firms are sending 2x as many messages per seat than the Al tools today, despite broad availability of these tools. Models are capable of far more than most organizations have embedded into workflows, and this presents an opportunity for firms.  \n\nLooking ahead, the next phase of enterprise Al will be shaped by stronger performance on economically valuable tasks, better understanding of organizational context, and a shift from asking models for outputs to delegating complex, multi-step workflows. As these capabilities mature, we expect organizations to not only improve efficiency, but discover new ways to serve customers and deliver value.  \n\nThe findings in this report represent early signs of how Al is beginning to reshape the modern enterprise. As enterprise Al evolves, OpenAl will continue to share real-world evidence on how Al is influencing firms, workers, and the broader economy.  \n\nRonnie Chatterji Chief Economist OpenAl  \n\nOver the past three years, enterprises have integrated Al systems across a wide range of use cases and operational workflows.  \n\nThese deployments provide insights on how Al is shaping work, particularly in environments where accuracy standards are high, workflows are complex, and improvements in productivity or decision quality have direct economic outcomes. Because much of the world's economically valuable activity occurs inside firms, enterprise adoption patterns provide a clear signal of where Al is delivering value today and where it will likely do so in the future.  \n\nThe scale and diversity of OpenAl's more than 1 million business customers provides a distinctive view into this shift. This report summarizes key findings from across OpenAl's enterprise customer base, and what those patterns suggest about the current state and trajectory of enterprise Al. By examining how adoption varies across industries and functions, the analysis also highlights where Al is becoming deeply embedded in firms, and where gaps are emerging.  \n\nFindings are based on two primary data sources  \n\n01 Real-world usage data from enterprise customers of OpenAl. 02 An OpenAl survey of 9,000 workers across almost 100 enterprises documenting patterns of Al adoption.  \n\nAll analyses in this report are based on de-identified, aggregated enterprise usage data. Message content was classified using automated systems, and no OpenAl employee reviewed individual enterprise, business, or API customerdata aspartofthis analysis.  \n\nEnterprise Al usage is accelerating and deepening  \n\nOver the past year, enterprise Al adoption has increased substantially as organizations incorporate Al into repeatable, multi-step workflows across functions and business units. OpenAl now serves more than 7 million ChatGPT workplace seats, and ChatGPT Enterprise seats have increased approximately $9\\times$ year-over-year.  \n\nSince November 2024, weekly Enterprise messages have grown approximately $8\\times$ in aggregate, with the average worker sending $30\\%$ more messages.This growth reflects both more frequent use of ChatGPT and a deepening in the intensity of use.  \n\nTwo shifts underscore the deepening integration of Al into core enterprise workflows.  \n\nCustom GPTs and Projects are enabling deeper workflow integration  \n\nGPTs and Projects are configurable interfaces built on ChatGPT that can be tailored with instructions, knowledge, and custom actions, enabling workers to execute repeatable, multi-step tasks.  \n\nWeekly users of Custom GPTs and Projects have increased by approximately $19\\times$ year-to-date. In recent months, approximately $20\\%$ of all Enterprise messages were processed via a Custom GPT or Project. The most widely deployed GPTs either codify institutional knowledge into reusable assistants or automate workflows through integrations with internal systems. Some organizations have built a culture of developing and sharing Custom GPTs at scale. For example, BBVA regularly uses more than 4,Oo0 GPTs, indicating that Al-driven workflows are increasingly implemented as persistent tools embedded in daily operations.  \n\n19x  \n\nYear-to-date increase in weekly users of Custom GPTs and Projects  \n\n20% of all Enterprise messages were processed via a Custom GPT or Project\n\nAl adoption and business impact: case evidence  \n\nThe following case studies illustrate how Al is generating measurable business outcomes across a range of organizational contexts.Ratherthan a one-size-fits-all solution, their impact reflect the application of Al to specific operational and strategic challenges. Across these examples, Al is associated with revenue growth, improvements in customer experience, automation of manual processes, and accelerated product development.  \n\nThese effects are not confined to a small set of firms, and external research shows that Al adoption is beginning to influence core financial performance indicators.  \n\nA 2025 Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study found that over the past three years, Al leaders achieved $1.7\\times$ revenue growth, $3.6\\times$ greater total shareholder return, and $1.6\\times$ EBIT margin. They also outperformed on nonfinancial measures such as patent output and employee satisfaction, linking Al maturity to both financial and organizational strength. While this evidence is still early, it suggests that Al adoption is correlated with improved financial performance and organizational outcomes.  \n\nCase studies  \n\np. 17 Intercom  \n\np.18 Lowe's  \n\np.19 Indeed  \n\np.20 BBVA  \n\np.21 Oscar Health  \n\np.22 Moderna  \n\nintercom  \n\nIntercom used OpenAl's Realtime APl for Fin Voice, delivering a low-latency, enterprise-ready voice Al Agent  \n\nChallenge  \n\nFin, Intercom's Al agent for customer service, delivers industry-leading resolution rates across chat, email, and social channels, resolving millions of customer queries each month. But extending Fin to a new channel — the phone - introduced a new, critical challenge: latency. In phone support, where issues are often urgent, even brief pauses can destroy the customer experience, and lead callers to abandon the interaction or escalate to a human.  \n\nSolution  \n\nIntercom built Fin Voice on OpenAl's Realtime API to dramatically reduce latency and enable natural, interruption-friendly phone conversations. The Realtime APl's low time-tofirst-token, strong instruction-following, and dependable tool-calling capabilities allow Fin Voice to navigate complex, multi-step requests with high quality and reliability.  \n\nImpact  \n\nLatency has decreased by $48\\%$ since March through Fin Voice's use of the Realtime API for answer generation.  \n\nWith faster responses enabled by the Realtime APl, customers are seeing Fin Voiceresolve $53\\%$ of calls end-to-end on average —- a significant result given that phone calls are typically far more complex than chat.  \n\nCustomers report that calls that ultimately require human agents are resolved $40\\%$ faster once Fin Voice completes the initial steps, improving efficiency on higher-touch calls.  \n\nGiven that human-handled support conversations typically cost upwards of $\\Phi5{-}\\Phi20$ (depending on region and industry), Fin is already saving customers hundreds of millions of dollars annually.  \n\nLowE'S'  \n\nLowe's deployed Mylow and Mylow Companion to scale expert home-improvement guidance to every online visitor and in-store associate  \n\nChallenge  \n\nSolution  \n\nLowe's needed to scale expert home improvement guidance to online shoppers and help store associates, especially new hires, answer complex questions consistently across more than 1,7o0 stores.  \n\nLowe's deployed Mylow on Lowes.com to provide customer project and product advice, and Mylow Companion for store associates in every store.  \n\nImpact  \n\nMylow and Mylow Companion answer nearly 1 million questions per month about everything from product specs to project know-how to the status of a customer order since launching in March of this year.  \n\nMylow is available on Lowes.com and in the award-winning Lowe's mobile app. When customers engage with Mylow during their online visits, the conversion rate more than doubles.  \n\nMylow Companion is deployed in $100\\%$ of stores and answers hundreds of thousands of associate questions each week. Lowe's is seeing customer satisfaction scores increase 2o0 basis points when associates use Mylow Companion to help customers shopping in the aisle.  \n\nindeed  \n\nIndeed uses GPT-powered job matching and career coaching to improve hiring outcomes for job seekers and employers  \n\nChallenge  \n\nIndeed's mission is to help people get jobs. Job seekers can face friction when searching. evaluating fit, and applying for roles, while employers want more qualified applicants for their open roles. Both sides benefit from deeper personalization and clearer context about what makes a strong match.  \n\nSolution  \n\nTo address this friction, Indeed launched a suite of Al-powered products, using its proprietary Al to match job seekers and employers coupled with GPT-powered explanations that help explain why they're a good fit. Indeed Invite to Apply uses Al to generate and send contextual, personalized job invitations at scale, helping candidates understand why a role is a strong match and improving employer reach. Indeed Career Scout acts as an Al career coach, accelerating job discovery and streamlining the application process for job seekers.  \n\nImpact  \n\nIn experiments, Invite to Apply with LLM-generated explanations increased started applications by $\\pmb{20\\%}$ and improved downstream success (interviews and hires) by $13\\%$ versus traditional matching.  \n\nEarly results show job seekers using Career Scout find and apply to relevant jobs $\\mathbf{7x}$ faster and are $\\pmb{38\\%}$ more likely to be hired, with $84\\%$ rating it valuable.  \n\nBBV^  \n\nBBVA deployed a legal Al chatbot to instantly validate corporate signatory authority and unblock branch commercial operations  \n\nChallenge  \n\nIn Mexico, BBVA must perform a legal check (also known as bastanteo) to confirm that a company representative has the authority to sigr and act on behalf of the company before key transactions can proceed (e.g., opening accounts, signing contracts, issuing credit). Historically, this process relied on a specialist legal team responding to repetitive branch queries, creating delays, bottlenecks, and high demand for scarce legal capacity.  \n\nSolution  \n\nBBVA built a generative Al chatbot that provides instant access to standardized, pre-validated legal FAQs and documentation guidance for common signatory-authority questions. The content was developed and reviewed by BBVA's Legal Services team, reducing manual handling of daily inquiries and making approved legal guidance consistently available.  \n\nImpact  \n\nThe solution built with ChatGPT Enterprise automates more than 9,000 queries annually and has enabled BBVA to redeploy the equivalent of 3 FTE's toward producing over 11,oo0 bastanteos per year, delivering $\\pmb{26\\%}$ of the Legal Services division's annual savings KPl.\n\nThe APl is most commonly used to build and scale customer-facing applications (e.g., in-product assistants, search, and automation), particularly by technology companies. But usage is diversifying: customer service and content generation now represent approximately $20\\%$ of API activity, and non-technology firm APl use has grown 5x year-over-year. Taken together, this pattern suggests adoption is expanding beyond technology-led product embedding toward a broader set of operational and workflow deployments across industries.  \n\nTechnology companies are  \n\nusing the APl at a rate 5x higher year-over-year as they scale external, customerfacing applications. They also lead in coding workflows, where frontier models such as Codex are accelerating software development.  \n\nProfessional services  \n\nconcentrate APl spend in coding and developer tools to build custom tooling that accelerates delivery, improves the customer experience (often via personalization), and enables assistant applications.  \n\nFinance organizations often start with customer-support because support is a large, scalable cost center with proven ROl. Coding and developer tools rank second as firms invest in system migration and custom applications for trading, risk, and compliance.  \n\nTop APl use cases  \n\n1. In-app Assistant & Search   \n2.

Data Analysis, Summarization & Extraction  \n\nEnterprise growth is global and accelerating  \n\nWhile early Al adoption was primarily U.S.-based, international growth is now accelerating rapidly:  \n\n· Among the largest markets, Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, and France show the fastest growth in business customers, increasing more than $143\\%$ year-over-year  \n\nChatGPT usage among business customers continues to scale globally, with the United States, Germany, and Japan among the most active markets by message volume.  \n\n. The United Kingdom and Germany now rank among the largest ChatGPT Enterprise markets outside the U.S. by number of customers.  \n\nInternational APl customer growth has exceeded $70\\%$ over the last 6 months, with Japan having the largest number of corporate APl customers outside of the U.S.  \n\nAustralia, Brazil, the Netherlands, and France are growing faster than the global average  \n\nPercentage increase in number of paying business customers (Nov.'24 to Nov.'25)  \n\nAustralia   \nBrazil   \nNetherlands   \nFrance   \nCanada   \nGlobal average   \nUnited States   \nGermany   \nUnited Kingdom   \nJapan  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \nMonthly business message volume  \n\nThe growing divide in Al adoption  \n\nThere are clear differences emerging in how Al is used across industries and among individuals within firms. Whether this gap widens or contracts will depend on how organizations approach change management and their ability to build the systems, skills, and operating models required to successfully deploy Al.  \n\nTo understand this growing divide more deeply, it is useful to compare frontier workers (defined as those in the 95th percentile of adoption intensity) to the median worker. Frontier workers generate $6\\times$ more messages than the median worker. Even among those who work in data analytics, frontier workers use the data-analysis tool 16x more than the median.  \n\nWorker usage gaps widen with more advanced tools  \n\nFrontier (95th percentile) vs median users  \n\n  \n\nThe gaps are widest between frontier and median workers for writing, coding, and analysis. Coding exhibits the largest relative gap in message volume, with frontier workers sending 17x as many messages as the median.  \n\n  \n\n  \nAl usage varies dramatically across tasks for frontier workers compared to median Comparison of 95th percentile-to-median  \n\nThese differences matter. Usage data matched to survey results show that users who engage across roughly seven task types report five times more time saved than those who use only about four. In other words, the benefits users realize from Al scale directly with depth of use.  \n\n  \nTime savings increase as users engage across more distinct tasks  \n\nEven among active ChatGPT Enterprise users, many have not tried some of the most capable tools. Of monthly active users, $19\\%$ have never used data analysis, $14\\%$ have never used reasoning, and $12\\%$ have never used search. Among daily active users, those shares drop to $3\\%$ 5 $1\\%$ , and $1\\%$ , respectively.  \n\nMonthly active users Daily active users  \n\n  \nPercent of Enterprise users who have not used these tools  \n\nThere's significant headroom for firms to increase their Al maturity  \n\nAt the firm level, gaps in adoption intensity mirror those observed at the individual level. Frontier firms (95th percentile) generate approximately $_{2\\times}$ more messages per seat than the median enterprise and $7\\times$ more messages to GPTs, indicating markedly deeper organizational integration and workflow standardization. These firms invest systematically in the infrastructure and operating models required to embed Al as core organizational capability rather than a peripheral productivity tool.  \n\nFirm usage gaps widen with more advanced tools  \n\nFrontier (95th percentile) vs median firms", "files_in_pdf": [{"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_2_6_10_1765473860/images/eq2oo5.jpg", "size": 73515}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_2_6_10_1765473860/images/nu9qrk.jpg", "size": 96080}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_2_6_10_1765473860/images/d0lkd9.jpg", "size": 3068}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_1_1_5_1765473860/images/xkwq0y.jpg", "size": 469341}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/qmcwmc.jpg", "size": 27670}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/1015om.jpg", "size": 72983}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/yydhrw.jpg", "size": 35185}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/ne5kx6.jpg", "size": 6915}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/wrco93.jpg", "size": 38707}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/x4j2ob.jpg", "size": 7769}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/u2y2j3.jpg", "size": 165937}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/svm4o2.jpg", "size": 63681}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_3_11_15_1765473865/images/t9l5wg.jpg", "size": 40153}]}
