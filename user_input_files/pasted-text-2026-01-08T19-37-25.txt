# 📬 **DRAFT MESSAGE FOR SYN**

***

**Subject:** 🚀 Cursor Feature Complete → Arsenal Carousel Implementation Next

***

Hey Syn,

Quick status update and transition to the next phase:

## ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Custom Rocket Pen Cursor**

Jules (Google Gemini) successfully implemented the custom cursor feature after navigating some complex Next.js 14 App Router hydration challenges. Here's what's live:

**What was built:**
- ✅ Custom Midas Gold pen tip cursor (replaces default arrow)
- ✅ `data-custom-cursor-enabled` attribute on `<html>` element for CSS control
- ✅ AccessibilityContext + AccessibilityProvider for global state management
- ✅ RootStyleManager component handling DOM attribute manipulation
- ✅ Build passing with no errors
- ✅ Feature verified and functional

**Files modified/created:**
- `components/RootStyleManager.tsx` (new)
- `contexts/AccessibilityContext.tsx` (new or updated)
- `app/globals.css` (cursor styles added)
- `app/layout.tsx` (integrated components)

You'll see these changes in the latest commit. The cursor system is production-ready.

## 🎯 **PHASE 2: ARSENAL VIDEO CAROUSEL** ← **You're Up**

We're now moving to the main feature: implementing the **3D curved video carousel** in The Arsenal section, inspired by the Alche.studio implementation we analyzed earlier.

### **The Vision:**
Transform The Arsenal section from static cards into an immersive 3D carousel showcasing our proof-of-work through video demonstrations. Think: curved TV screens arranged in a circle, rotating on scroll, with only the center card playing its video.

**Reference site:** https://alche.studio/ (scroll to their Works section to see the effect)

***

## 📋 **YOUR IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF**

### **Approach: CSS 3D + Framer Motion** (NOT Three.js WebGL)

We're going with the **hybrid approach** Circuit recommended:
- 90% of the visual impact
- 20% of the complexity  
- Better performance
- Easier maintenance
- Faster delivery

**Why this matters:** We need this shipped in days, not weeks. CSS 3D gives us the premium look without the WebGL complexity.

***

### **Technical Specifications:**

**Target Section:** The Arsenal (`/components/ArsenalSection` or wherever it lives in your structure)

**Carousel Requirements:**
- **3 video cards** (one for each proof point):
  1. AI Systems Architecture
  2. Full-Stack Autonomous Development
  3. Performance & SEO 2.0
  
- **Arrangement:** Circular 3D layout (120° spacing between cards)
- **Interaction:** Scroll-driven rotation OR drag gestures
- **Auto-play:** Only the center-facing card plays video; others pause
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 curved screens
- **Style:** Dark metallic bezels, subtle glow effects

**Performance Targets:**
- Desktop: 60fps
- Mobile: 30fps (acceptable fallback)
- Lighthouse: Maintain 95+ score

***

### **Component Structure:**

Here's the recommended file organization:

```
/components/Arsenal/
├── ArsenalCarousel.tsx          // Main carousel container
├── CurvedVideoCard.tsx          // Individual video card component
├── useCarouselScroll.ts         // Custom hook for scroll control
└── arsenalData.ts               // Video sources + metadata
```

**Or integrate into existing Arsenal structure if you prefer.**

***

### **Tech Stack:**

You already have these installed:
- ✅ Framer Motion (for animations)
- ✅ React/Next.js 14
- ✅ TypeScript

You may want to add:
```bash
npm install react-use-gesture
```
*(Only if you want drag gestures - optional for Phase 1)*

***

### **Key Implementation Details:**

#### **1. Curved Screen Effect (CSS 3D)**
Use CSS transforms to create the curved TV appearance:

```css
.video-card {
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  perspective: 1000px;
  transform: rotateY(var(--rotation)) translateZ(var(--depth));
  
  /* Curved screen illusion via gradient overlay */
  background: linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    rgba(255,255,255,0.05) 0%,
    transparent 20%,
    transparent 80%,
    rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 100%
  );
  
  /* Metallic bezel */
  border: 3px solid #1a1a1a;
  box-shadow: 
    inset 0 0 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.3),
    0 10px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}
```

#### **2. Scroll-Driven Rotation**
Map scroll position to carousel rotation:

```typescript
const handleScroll = () => {
  const scrollProgress = // calculate based on section position
  const rotation = scrollProgress * Math.PI * 2; // 0-360°
  setCarouselRotation(rotation);
};
```

#### **3. Video Management**
Critical for performance:
- Preload only adjacent cards (center ± 1)
- Lazy load others
- Auto-play only center card
- Pause others immediately

#### **4. Responsive Behavior**
- **Desktop (1440px+):** Full 3D carousel
- **Tablet (768-1439px):** Simplified depth, 2 cards visible
- **Mobile (<768px):** Flat horizontal scroll, no 3D

***

### **Video Assets Status:**

**IMPORTANT:** We're waiting on the video team to produce the 3 Arsenal videos. 

**Specs they're following:**
- Format: MP4 (H.264)
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Duration: 15-20 seconds each
- File size: <8MB
- Audio: NONE (muted for autoplay)
- Loop: Seamless

**For now:** Use placeholder videos or static images to build the structure. We can swap in real videos once they're ready.

### **Circuit's Complete Implementation Guide:**

I have a **comprehensive step-by-step implementation manual** from Circuit (our senior web dev consultant) that breaks down:
- Full component code (copy-paste ready)
- CSS styling with curved screen effects
- Scroll interpolation logic
- Video playback optimization
- Performance considerations
- Mobile fallback strategies

**I can send you:**
1. The full implementation guide (it's detailed - about 500+ lines of documented code)
2. Just the core carousel component to get started
3. Both, if you want the complete picture

**Which would be most helpful for you?**

***

### **Suggested Implementation Phases:**

**Phase 1: Structure** (Day 1-2)
- Build basic 3D carousel (no videos yet)
- Get 3 cards arranged in circle
- Implement scroll-driven rotation
- Test smooth animation

**Phase 2: Video Integration** (Day 2-3)
- Add video elements to cards
- Implement auto-play logic
- Add loading states
- Test performance

**Phase 3: Polish** (Day 3-4)
- Curved screen effects
- Metallic bezels and shadows
- Glow/light effects
- Mobile responsive behavior

**Phase 4: Optimization** (Day 4-5)
- Performance tuning
- Lazy loading
- Preload strategy
- Cross-browser testing

## 🤝 **What I Need From You:**

1. **Confirm approach:** Are you comfortable with CSS 3D + Framer Motion, or do you want to discuss other options?

2. **Current Arsenal section:** Where does it live in the codebase? Is it a separate component or part of the main page?

3. **Preference on code delivery:** 
   - Want the full guide upfront?
   - Prefer to start with basic structure and iterate?
   - Want a quick call to align on approach?

4. **Timeline:** What's realistic for you? Circuit estimated 3-5 days for a polished implementation.

5. **Video placeholders:** Do you want me to provide dummy video URLs, or will you use static images as placeholders?
