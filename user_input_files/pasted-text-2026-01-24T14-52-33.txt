The user wants to know the section order and naming conventions that we came up with for the site. From the page.tsx file, I can see the current structure. Let me also check the individual section files to get the exact titles and descriptions that we implemented.

The current order in page.tsx is:
1. GalaxyBackground (background layer)
2. HeroSection
3. ModernTouchManifesto
4. MeetTheForge
5. ArsenalSection (comment: "Armory - Strategic weapons in the war for digital dominance")
6. AIToolsSection (comment: "Command Center - Arsenal of Intelligence renamed")
7. ArchitectSection (comment: "Architect Section with Particle Brain")
8. CredentialsSection (comment: "Architect's Foundation")
9. LogoStorySection
10. ConnectionSection
11. CompanyLogoSection
12. Footer

# Site Section Order and Naming Convention

Based on the restructured flow we implemented, here is the complete section order and naming convention for the site:

## Section Flow (Top to Bottom)

**1. GalaxyBackground**
The foundational animated layer that sits behind everything, featuring stars, nebulae, comets, and lens flares in a warm golden palette. This is not a visible section but rather the atmospheric foundation of the entire site experience.

**2. HeroSection — The Solar System**
The main landing section featuring the central logo as a "sun" with orbiting planets. This section establishes the cosmic theme with a solar system metaphor where the logo serves as the gravitational center. The section includes animated planet orbits, the main logo/sun, and establishes the golden color palette.

**3. ModernTouchManifesto — MODERN TOUCH MANIFESTO**
The "About Us" section that introduces the brand philosophy. It uses an editorial serif style with a two-column layout featuring a video or media area on the left and manifesto content on the right. The section header displays "MODERN TOUCH MANIFESTO" in large typography with a gold accent line beneath.

**4. MeetTheForge — Meet The Forge**
The AI team introduction section that presents four specialized AI intelligences working in unison. Each character appears as a card with stats, narrative descriptions, and visual representations:

- **Goldie** — "The Visionary Spark" (Action: ADOPT)
- **Roman** — "The Strategic Engineer" (Action: ENHANCE)
- **Nina** — "The Reality Check" (Action: DEPLOY)
- **Echo** — "The Market Heartbeat" (Action: PULSE)

**5. ArsenalSection — Armory**
The services section themed as "strategic weapons in the war for digital dominance." It displays three core capabilities as cards:

- AI Systems Architecture — "Designing and building proprietary, automated AI systems that serve as strategic weapons for business."
- Full-Stack Autonomous Development — "Orchestrating full-stack applications from concept to deployment with ruthless efficiency and elegant precision."
- Performance & SEO 2.0 — "Engineering applications for 'Performance Beast Mode' with Lighthouse scores of 95+ and advanced discoverability."

**6. AIToolsSection — Command Center**
The technology showcase section (previously "Arsenal of Intelligence") that displays the AI tools and platforms utilized. It presents a grid of AI technologies including Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, MiniMax, DeepSeek, and Custom AI systems, each with their brand colors and descriptions.

**7. ArchitectSection — Architect**
The technical showcase section featuring the "Particle Brain" — a 3D Spline visualization of the AI systems architecture. This section demonstrates the technical capabilities through an interactive 3D brain visualization with animated particle effects and a fallback for when the Spline scene doesn't load.

**8. CredentialsSection — Architect's Foundation**
The education and credentials section that presents professional background. It displays credentials as collectible items with icons representing:

- High School Diploma
- Bachelor's Degree
- Advanced Studies
- Professional Certification
- Specialized Training

**9. LogoStorySection**
The section that tells the story behind the logo design, explaining the symbolism and meaning behind the visual identity.

**10. ConnectionSection**
The contact or connection section that allows visitors to reach out or connect with the brand.

**11. CompanyLogoSection**
A section showcasing the company logo, potentially with different variations or applications of the brand mark.

**12. Footer**
The final footer section with navigation links, social media connections, and closing branding elements.

## Design Philosophy

The entire structure follows a "digital foundry" or "architect's studio" metaphor, positioning the brand as creators and builders of AI-powered digital experiences. Each section builds upon the previous one, moving from the cosmic/heroic introduction (Solar System) through the team introduction (Forge), capabilities demonstration (Armory and Command Center), technical proof (Architect), credibility establishment (Foundation), and finally connection and closure.
